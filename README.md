## Objective
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The objective of this project is to predict the selling prices of houses for a real estate app. Static historical data was gathere from Kaggle, on past house sales, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot acre, house size and state or region in United States, along with the final selling price. 
The purpose is to implement and deploy machine learning model(s) that can accurately predict the selling price of a house based on its features. Additionally, by using multiple machine learning models, the app evaluates the ML performance against scoring metrics, to provide the user the best ML option. 
This project aims to help the company make informed decisions based on accurate predictions and improve their business outcomes.




## Environment setup

## Next steps
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Initial data capture - better, more robust data sets, time series data, paid APIs
- Include attributes like `price_per_sq_ft`, `address`, `date_sold`, etc.
- Use conformal prediction to find the best ranked sore for price predictions
- Blockchain implementation: By recording real estate data on a blockchain, we can create a transparent and immutable record of real estate transactions. This can help prevent fraud and corruption, as all transactions are publicly visible and cannot be altered after the fact.
- Rental predictions based on bed, batha nd square footage
- Realestate portfolio creation and management for investors
- House price prediction based on sq footage price using time series data
